				<h2>Keyboard Review</h2> <!-- Title for first front page review section -->
				<p>This review will be convering a mechanical keyboard I recently ordered from Amazon. It came with a connecting cord, a set of keycaps, and a tool to put the keycaps in. From initial use it has a satisfying typing sound and is rather small which is good for smaller desk spaces. It also have multiple light features. One thing however, you can't change the color of the lighting inside the keyboard.</p> <!-- Description of first front page review section -->
                <p>In terms of pricing, it was rather cheap costing me only $35. Overall I'd rate this keyboard high and would recommend it if you're in the market for one.</p> <!-- Description of first front page review section -->
