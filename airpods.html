				<h2>Airpods Case Review</h2> <!-- Title for first front page review section -->
				<p>This review will be convering an AirPods case I recently bought on Amazon.</p> <!-- Description of first front page review section -->
                <p>These were from the store "QingQing" and are for 3rd Generation AirPods. They are based on the gaming console Nintendo Switch and came with a hook in case you wanted to attach it to any bags. In terms of material and feel, they feel great to hold and essentially resemble acutually holding joycons. They also are compatible with wireless charging and have a hole at the bottom for wired charging. For it's price I'd 100% reccomend this case if you're a Nintendo Fan and were in the market for a case.</p> <!-- Description of first front page review section -->
